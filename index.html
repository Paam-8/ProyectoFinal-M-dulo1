            <h3>Clinical lab technician</h3>
            <P>
                The skills I learned during basic clinical laboratory studies
                include ability to inoculate and grow bacterial samples in
                Petri dishes: methodology for drawing and analyzing blood
                in specialized equipment; handling and analysis of samples
                under microscope; practical use and knowledge of
                laboratory instruments, and customer service (volunteers
                during practices)

            <h3>Chemical lab practices</h3>
            <p>
                During the chemical engineering lab practices, I’ve
                acquired skills with the chemical lab instrumentation, such as
                the use of analytical balances; practical use of the Bunsen
                burner; use of various viscosity measuring devices;
                knowledge of distillation tower; equipment amounting;
                basic lab chemicals and solutions, and several others. As
                well as the necessary knowledge to carry out solution
                practices, such as calculating concentrations and volumes;
                pipetting; and various other techniques required for the
                chemical lab practices.
