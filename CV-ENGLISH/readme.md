# Final project - Module 1

This is the website version of my CV. It has an interactive navigation of the various sections in the site, and contains basic personal info, contact info, education info, and working experience info.

The way to open the website from the Github repository, is going to the About menu on the right, and on the section Deployments, select the option "github-pages" and it'll load another page, where there will be a link in the center of the screen, click it and it'll load the CV website.
